# compressibleflow
This  Python library has developed in order to simulate compressible flows in 1D domain. By using this library, normal shock position in converging-diverging nozzles can be obtained by iterative numerical methods. Following numerical methods has been integrated and they are optional while solving quadratic equations;

1 - Bisection Method (default method - stable)
2 - Golden-Section Method
3 - Secant Method
