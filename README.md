# compressibleflow
This  Python library has developed in order to simulate compressible flows in 1D domain. By using this library, normal shock position in Converging-Diverging(CD) nozzles can be obtained by iterative numerical methods. Following numerical methods has been integrated and they are optional while solving quadratic equations;

1 - Bisection Method (default method - most stable) <br />
2 - Golden-Section Method <br />
3 - Secant Method <br />

**Fluid_Mechanics_White_7th** script includes series of solutions of examples of Compressible Flow section (Chapter 9) in Frank White's Fluid Mechanics book (7th Edition). <br />

**shock_location.py** script determines and visualizes shock position in CD Nozzle. <br />

**white_9_4.py** script is a solution of 4th example of Compressible Flow section (Chapter 9) in Frank White's Fluid Mechanics book (7th Edition). <br />
